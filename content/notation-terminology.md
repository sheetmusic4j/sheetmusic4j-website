A visual glossary of the notation elements Sheetmusic4J renders, so you can point at something in a screenshot and know exactly which class/method is responsible for it. Rendered from `fxdemo/src/test/resources/xmlsamples/SchbAvMaSample.musicxml` (Schubert's *Ave Maria*), the same fixture used throughout development.

## How to Use This When Reporting a Difference

Instead of "the horizontal line above the notes is too low", say "the beam is too low", then check the table below for `Beam` to jump straight to `Engraver.computeStemTips` / `naturalStem`. The goal is to skip a round of "what do you mean by X" every time something looks off.

## Element Reference

Every element flows through the same three layers: MusicXML to core model to engraving layout to painter. The table gives the concrete name at each stage.

## Notes on a Few Non-Obvious Rules

* **Accidentals are never inferred from pitch.** A note's `alter` (e.g. -1 for flat) only encodes the *sounding* pitch, it does not mean the flat should be drawn. Only an explicit `<accidental>` element in the source causes a glyph to appear. This matches standard MusicXML: the authoring software already decided where accidentals are visually needed (key signature, courtesy, previous note in the measure) and encodes that decision directly.
* **Stem direction prefers the explicit `<stem>` element** over a pitch-based guess, because a beamed run can span notes on both sides of the staff's middle line, so guessing per note independently can flip direction mid-beam.
* **A beamed run shares one stem length**, computed from the highest/lowest notehead across the entire run (not each note's own pitch), so every stem reaches the same beam height instead of some falling short.
* **Slurs track the pitch extremes of every note they span** (not just their two endpoints), so a phrase that arcs up to a peak and back down gets a curve that clears the peak instead of cutting through it.
* **Tuplets and slurs both use MusicXML's `number` attribute** to pair a `start` with its matching `stop` when several are nested/concurrent.
* **"Measure" and "bar" are the same thing**, the horizontal span between two barlines. *Measure* is the American term, *bar* the British one; the codebase uses `Measure` throughout (mirroring MusicXML's `<measure>`), but bug reports and issues may use either interchangeably.
